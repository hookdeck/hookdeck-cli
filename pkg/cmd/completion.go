Suggested next steps:
---------------------`

1. Move ` + "`hookdeck-completion.zsh`" + ` to the correct location:
    mkdir -p ~/.hookdeck
    mv hookdeck-completion.zsh ~/.hookdeck

2. Add the following lines to your ` + "`.zshrc`" + ` enabling shell completion for Hookdeck:
    fpath=(~/.hookdeck $fpath)
    autoload -Uz compinit && compinit -i

3. Source your ` + "`.zshrc`" + ` or open a new terminal session:
    source ~/.zshrc`

	bashCompletionInstructionsMac = `
Set up bash autocompletion on your system:
1. Install the bash autocompletion package:
     brew install bash-completion
2. Follow the post-install instructions displayed by Homebrew; add a line like the following to your bash profile:
     [[ -r "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh" ]] && . "/usr/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh"

Set up Hookdeck autocompletion:
3. Move ` + "`hookdeck-completion.bash`" + ` to the correct location:
    mkdir -p ~/.hookdeck
    mv hookdeck-completion.bash ~/.hookdeck

4. Add the following line to your bash profile, so that Hookdeck autocompletion will be enabled every time you start a new terminal session:
    source ~/.hookdeck/hookdeck-completion.bash

5. Either restart your terminal, or run the following command in your current session to enable immediately:
    source ~/.hookdeck/hookdeck-completion.bash`

	bashCompletionInstructionsLinux = `
1. Ensure bash autocompletion is installed on your system. Often, this means verifying that ` + "`/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh`" + ` exists, and is sourced by your bash profile; the location of this file varies across distributions of Linux.

2. Move ` + "`hookdeck-completion.bash`" + ` to the correct location:
    mkdir -p ~/.hookdeck
    mv hookdeck-completion.bash ~/.hookdeck

3. Add the following line to your bash profile, so that Hookdeck autocompletion will be enabled every time you start a new terminal session:
    source ~/.hookdeck/hookdeck-completion.bash

4. Either restart your terminal, or run the following command in your current session to enable immediately:
    source ~/.hookdeck/hookdeck-completion.bash`
