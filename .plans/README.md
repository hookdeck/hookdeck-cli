## Connection Management Gap Analysis & Implementation Plan

[connection-management-gap-analysis.md](./connection-management-gap-analysis.md) is definitive plan for moving connection support to 100%.

Why This Is The Definitive Plan
This document provides:

1. Complete Feature Audit (Lines 9-393)
✅ What's implemented (11 commands)
❌ What's missing (detailed breakdown by category)
Feature completeness matrix showing 45% complete
2. Critical Gap Identification
HTTP destinations blocked (line 151: "explicitly not implemented")
No authentication configuration for sources or destinations
No rule support (retry, filter, transform, delay, deduplicate)
Type-specific config handling missing
3. Implementation Strategies (Lines 72-261)
Addresses your core question about handling varying config based on type:

Option 1: Type-Driven Flag Exposure (lines 76-96)
Option 2: Universal Flag Set with Validation (lines 97-111) - Recommended
Option 3: JSON Config Fallback (lines 113-123)
4. Prioritized Roadmap (Lines 394-512)
Clear 5-week plan:

Priority 1: HTTP Destinations with Authentication (Week 1)
Priority 2: Source Authentication (Week 2)
Priority 3: Basic Rule Configuration (Week 3)
Priority 4: Extended Update Operations (Week 4)
Priority 5: Advanced Features (Week 5+)
5. File-Level Implementation Guidance (Lines 408-453)
Exact files to modify with line numbers:

pkg/cmd/connection_create.go:181-201 (HTTP destinations)
pkg/cmd/connection_create.go:146-165 (source auth)
pkg/hookdeck/connections.go (rules configuration)
Other Planning Documents
For context, these other documents show how we got here:

.plans/connection-management/connection-management-implementation.md

Original implementation plan (Phase 1 focus)
Guided the 45% that's currently implemented
Status: Partially executed
.plans/resource-management-implementation.md

Master plan for ALL resources (projects, sources, destinations, connections, transformations)
Now updated with status section pointing to gap analysis
Scope: Broader - covers all resources
Summary
Use connection-management-gap-analysis.md as your implementation guide to complete connection management. It provides:

✅ Detailed feature gaps with exact flag definitions
✅ Type-specific configuration strategies (your key question)
✅ Prioritized implementation roadmap
✅ File-level change specifications
✅ Risk assessment and action plan
✅ Path from 45% → 100% completion
The gap analysis is actionable - you can start implementing Priority 1 (HTTP destinations) immediately using the guidance provided in lines 396-411.
